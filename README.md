🔥 Selenium Firefox Automation Bot 🚀
This project demonstrates how to automate logging into a website using Selenium and GeckoDriver for Firefox. The script opens Firefox, navigates to a webpage, and logs in using the provided username and password.

🚀 Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python (version 3.x recommended) 🐍

Selenium Python package 📦

GeckoDriver for Firefox 🌐

Firefox browser 🦊

🛠️ Installation
Step 1: Install Selenium
To install Selenium, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install selenium
Step 2: Download GeckoDriver
Go to the GeckoDriver releases page 🔗

Download the version that matches your operating system 💻

Extract the downloaded file and place it somewhere on your system.

Either:

Add the path to GeckoDriver to your system's PATH, or

Specify the path directly in the script (as shown below).

Step 3: Install Firefox
Make sure that Firefox is installed on your system. If not, you can download it from here 🌍.

🏃‍♂️ Usage
Step 1: Set the GeckoDriver Path
In the script, replace "geckodriver.exe" with the actual path to your GeckoDriver executable.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
geko_path = "/path/to/geckodriver"
Step 2: Script Overview
This script uses Selenium to:

🦊 Open Firefox.

🌐 Navigate to Google.

✍️ Prompt for username and password.

🔐 Automatically fill out the login form (for demo purposes).

🖥️ Print the title of the webpage.

Step 3: Running the Script
Download the script file and open it in your text editor or IDE 📝.

Run the script using Python:

bash
Copy
Edit
python script_name.py
You'll be prompted to enter a username and password. The script will fill out the login form and print the page title to the console 📣.

Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
Enter the username: myuser
Enter the password: mypassword
⚠️ Important Notes
The current script uses placeholder selectors like id/class/username, id/class/password, and id/class/login. You'll need to replace these with the actual name, id, or class values for the form elements you're working with.

📜 This script is for educational purposes only. Please ensure you're following the website's terms of service when automating interactions.

🐛 Troubleshooting
If you run into issues, check the following:

GeckoDriver not found: Ensure the path to GeckoDriver is correct or add it to your system's PATH.

Element not found: Double-check the selectors for the form fields you're interacting with.

Permission issues: If you're encountering permission errors, try running the script as an administrator or adjust the permissions for the geckodriver.exe.
