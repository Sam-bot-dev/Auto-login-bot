A Python script to automate browser actions using **Selenium** and **GeckoDriver** for **Firefox**. This project demonstrates how to interact with websites by simulating user login behavior.

---

## üåü Features

* **Automated Browsing:** Launches Firefox and navigates to a specified webpage.
* **Login Automation:** Simulates filling out and submitting login forms.
* **Browser Interaction:** Allows you to interact with forms and elements on the page.
* **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Can be easily modified to work with Chrome, Edge, and others.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your machine. You will also need:

* **Selenium** library
* **GeckoDriver** for Firefox
* **Firefox** browser installed on your system

---

### 1. Install Selenium

To install **Selenium**, open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install selenium
```
Step 2: Install Selenium
To install Selenium, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install selenium
Step 3: Download GeckoDriver
Go to the GeckoDriver releases page.

Download the version that matches your operating system.

Extract the downloaded file and place it somewhere on your system.

Either:

Add the path to GeckoDriver to your system‚Äôs PATH, or

Specify the path directly in the script (as shown below).

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
geko_path = "/path/to/geckodriver"
Step 4: Install Firefox
If Firefox is not already installed, you can download it from here.

üßë‚Äçüíª Script Usage
1. Set the GeckoDriver Path
In the script, replace "geckodriver.exe" with the actual path to your GeckoDriver executable.

Example:

python
Copy
Edit
geko_path = "/path/to/geckodriver"
2. Running the Script
Once you've set up the GeckoDriver, you can run the script with Python. Here's how to do it:

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory containing your Python script.

Run the script using Python:

bash
Copy
Edit
python script_name.py
3. Enter Username and Password
The script will prompt you for a username and password. Enter them when prompted, and the script will fill in the login form and simulate a login attempt.

Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
Enter the username: myuser
Enter the password: mypassword
üìù Code Overview
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how the script works:

Launch Firefox: The script uses Selenium to open Firefox.

Navigate to the website: It automatically opens the specified webpage (currently set to Google).

Enter credentials: The script simulates entering a username and password into form fields.

Click the login button: The script simulates clicking the login button.

Print the page title: After logging in, the script prints the title of the webpage to the console.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
Element Selectors: The script uses placeholder selectors like id/class/username, id/class/password, and id/class/login. You'll need to replace them with the correct name, id, or class values from the website you're automating.

Website Terms: Always ensure that you're adhering to the website's terms of service when automating interactions.

Educational Use: This script is intended for educational purposes. Be mindful of how you use it.

üêõ Troubleshooting
If you run into any issues, here are some common solutions:

GeckoDriver not found: Make sure that the path to GeckoDriver is correctly set in the script or added to your system's PATH.

You can set the path in the script like this:

python
Copy
Edit
gecko_path = "/path/to/geckodriver"
Element not found: Double-check the element selectors (username, password, login) to ensure they match the elements on the webpage you're interacting with.

Permission issues: If you encounter permission issues, try running the script as an administrator or adjust the permissions for the GeckoDriver executable.

Script not running: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed and that you're running the correct command for your environment.
